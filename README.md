### Hi there 👋
- 💚 I'm a junior CS researcher working on Software Engineering related research.
- 💙 I’m currently learning Japanese 日本語 :)
- 💜 Pronouns: HAPPY-GIRL-Z-T
- 🌈 Fun fact: I created this username in the fourth grade. As I grow older, having such a username makes me a little embarrassed. :) Anyway, I will always use that username.
