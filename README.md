### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**happygirlzt/happygirlzt** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Software Engineering related research. I am a junior CS researcher.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Japanese :)
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: follow me.. HAPPY-GIRL-Z-T :D
- âš¡ Fun fact: I created this username when I was in the fourth grade. I am a bit embarrassed to have such a username as I am growing older. :) Anyway, I will keep using this username forever.
